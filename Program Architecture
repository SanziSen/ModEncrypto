1) Application reads the
time(seconds) of last opening of
any pre user entered program

2) While the application reads each characters
from a user specified file, it adds some ASCII
value to that character which is equal to the last
two digit numbered current microseconds
subtracted by the time determined by previous
step, thus every character is encrypted in some
other format each it is read

3) In the encrypted file, the microseconds time is
stored for every character in ASCII form and the
time of last execution of the previously said
application is saved in number format

4) The decryptor program reads each character, its
microseconds time and the time of execution of
the said file last opened and reverses the said
steps to decrypt the file
